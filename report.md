# Lab 1 Report

Joe Blow  
CpS 209  
August 31, 2022

Time spent: 3 hours.

## Work Completed

I certify that I completed all steps in the lab using my own computer.

**Step 3:** The transmogrifier failed to engage when I tested using option 1.
When I tried again with option 2, it engaged properly.

## Known Issues

* Step 6 wouldn't work for me as shown. I had to throw the computer in the air
  and click my heels together 3 times in order to get it to work.
